# Portfolio page in new style!

[DEMO](https://markficht.github.io/my-portfolio/build/)

ATM: I know that this site doesn't have a good mechanism, but I built it for the initial layout. The next step will be optimization.

The goal was to create a different page than all. <br/>
We will get to individual sections by the tiles

### In construction
- Mailings
- Optimization
